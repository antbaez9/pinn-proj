# [Guaranteeing Conservation Laws with Projection in Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17445)

This code contains the PINN, PINN-SC, and PINN-Proj models used in the above paper. The code for the PINN and PINN-Proj models are contained in the '* Inference.ipynb' files. The projection layer can be enabled/disabled by uncommenting/commenting code located in the 'net_u' object. More info can be found in the comments. 'The code for the PINN-SC models are contained in the '* Inference soft constraint.ipynb' files.

Feel free to open an issue if you find a bug or have a question!
